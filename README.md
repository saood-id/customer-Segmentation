# customer-Segmentation
Today many of the businesses are going  online  and,  in  this  case,  online marketing is becoming  essential  to  hold  customers,  but  during  this,  considering  all  customers  as same and targeting all of them with similar marketing strategy is not very efficient way rather it's also annoys the customers by neglecting his or her individuality, so customer segmentation is becoming very popular and also  became the efficient  solution for  this existing problem. Customer  segmentation  is  defined as dividing  company's  customers on  the  basis  of  demographic  (age,  gender,  marital  status)  and  behavioral  (types  of products ordered,  annual income) aspects. Since  demographic characteristics does  not emphasize on individuality of customer because  same  age  groups  may  have different interests  so  behavioral  aspects  is  a better  approach  for  customer segmentation  as  its focus on individuality and we can do proper segmentation with the help of it.
